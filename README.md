# Esther-Paddy-Utility-usage-by-customer- This project analyses utility consumption patterns among customers to provide insights into usage trends, customer segmentation, customer payment trends, and peak demand periods. The goal is to help utility providers better understand customer behaviour, improve demand forecasting, and optimise resource allocation.
- Insights: Analysis of this utility usage by customers data revealed that certain regions and customer segments consistently exhibit higher resource consumption, indicating potential revenue concentration in specific geographic areas and among high-usage customers. Additionally, seasonal patterns in usage highlights predictable demand fluctuations across different utility services. The analysis also indicated that some regions and specific customer segments consistently struggle with timely bill payments, resulting in a higher rate of overdue accounts.
- Recommendation: Targeted strategies (like customised premium plans, incentives for higher usage and seasonal discounts in high-usage regions) focused on high-usage regions and premium customer segments should be put in place to maximise revenue, while implementing demand forecasting based on seasonal usage trends to optimise resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency. Strategies to encourage timely bill payments in overdue regions and segments could include early payment discounts, automated payment reminders, flexible payment palns, late payment penalties, easy online payment options, prepaid or budget billing options, loyalty rewards for consistent payment history, and dedicated customer support for overdue accounts.
